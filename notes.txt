Change JList to make it more efficient
	- Make it contain a variant that first holds a vector of Expr* during initiaization
		and then switches to a vector of JValue*'s.

Token class should own the memory of JValue's 

Change the dynamic_casts in void jl::MemoryPool::mark(Ref* ref) to something similar
	to the type_id enum used in JlValue
